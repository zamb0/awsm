## Installation

### From Releases

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/AleG03/awsm/releases).
Copy the binary to your PATH and run `awsm` from anywhere.
For MacOS users, you can also copy the binary into /usr/local/bin and run from everyone.
For arch linux users, the binary is available in the AUR.

### Using Homebrew

If you have Homebrew installed, you can install awsm with:

```bash
brew tap aleg03/awsm
brew install awsm
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AleG03/awsm.git
cd awsm
go build -o awsm .
```

## Usage

### Profile Management

```bash
# List all profiles
awsm profile list

# List profiles with detailed information
awsm profile list --detailed

# Login to SSO profile and set as active
awsm profile set my-profile

# Change default region for a profile
awsm profile change-default-region my-profile eu-central-1

# Add new profiles
awsm profile add iam-user my-user        # Add IAM user profile with access keys
awsm profile add iam-role my-role        # Add IAM role with assumption

# Edit profiles
awsm profile edit my-profile             # Edit existing profile interactively

# Delete profiles
awsm profile delete my-profile           # Delete single profile
awsm profile delete --all-sso my-session # Delete all profiles for SSO session
awsm profile delete --force my-profile   # Delete without confirmation
```

### Interactive Profile Selection

```bash
# Interactive profile selector with arrow keys
awsm select
```

### Identity & Status

```bash
# Show the active identity (account, ARN, region, credentials TTL)
awsm whoami

# Inspect a specific profile without switching to it
awsm whoami --profile my-profile

# Machine-readable output for scripts
awsm whoami --json

# Skip the sts:GetCallerIdentity call (offline / fast)
awsm whoami --no-call
```

The TTL is color-coded: green when there's plenty of time left, amber under 30
minutes, red under 5 minutes or already expired. SSO profiles use the SSO
access-token cache to compute the remaining lifetime.

### Run Commands With Profile Credentials

`awsm run` resolves credentials for the chosen profile (auto-prompting MFA and
auto-running `aws sso login` if needed) and executes the given command with
`AWS_*` environment variables injected. The parent shell is **not** modified.

```bash
# Use the active profile
awsm run -- aws s3 ls

# Pin a specific profile / region for the child process
awsm run --profile prod -- terraform plan
awsm run --profile dev --region eu-west-1 -- env | grep AWS_
```

Anything before `--` is parsed as `awsm` flags; everything after is the command
to execute. The child process's exit code is propagated.

### Shell Prompt Integration

`awsm prompt` prints a compact one-line status string designed to be embedded
in your shell prompt. It is fast and offline (no AWS API calls).

```bash
# Default format: "{icon} {profile}:{region} {ttl}"
awsm prompt

# Custom format
awsm prompt --format '{profile}@{region} ({ttl})'
awsm prompt --format '☁ {profile}'

# Disable ANSI colors
awsm prompt --no-color

# Print nothing if no profile is active (instead of "(no profile)")
awsm prompt --empty-on-none
```

Available placeholders: `{profile}`, `{region}`, `{type}`, `{ttl}`, `{account}`,
`{icon}`.

**Starship example** (`~/.config/starship.toml`):

```toml
[custom.awsm]
command = "awsm prompt --no-color"
when = "awsm profile current"
format = "[$output]($style) "
style = "bold cyan"
```

**Bash/Zsh PS1 example**:

```bash
PS1='$(awsm prompt --empty-on-none) \w $ '
```

### Diagnostics

`awsm doctor` audits the local environment and prints a categorized report
(versions, AWS files and permissions, external tools, awsm config, profiles
and cache, browsers). It exits non-zero if any check is `FAIL`.

```bash
awsm doctor

# Machine-readable output (great for bug reports)
awsm doctor --json
```

### SSO Management

```bash
# Add SSO session to config and automatically generate profiles
awsm sso add my-session https://d-123456789.awsapps.com/start/ us-east-1

# Login to SSO session
awsm sso login my-sso-session

# Generate profiles from SSO (discovers all accounts/roles)
awsm sso generate my-sso-session

# List all SSO Sessions
awsm sso list

# List SSO Sessions with detailed information
awsm sso list --detailed

# Delete SSO session and all associated profiles
awsm sso delete my-session               # Interactive deletion
awsm sso delete --force my-session       # Delete without confirmation
```

### Credential Management

# Clear all credentials from default profile
awsm clear

# Export/Import configurations
awsm export [output-file]               # Export all profiles and SSO sessions
awsm import <export-file>                # Import from export file
awsm import --force <export-file>        # Import without confirmation
```

### Console Access

AWSM can open the AWS console in your browser with proper credentials. It supports both Chrome profiles and Firefox containers for better organization.

#### Basic Usage

```bash
# Open AWS console in default browser
awsm console

# Just print the URL without opening browser
awsm console --no-open
```

#### Chrome Profile Integration

To use Chrome profiles with AWSM, you need to configure profile mappings in your AWSM configuration file.

**Step 1: Find Your Chrome Profile Numbers**

Chrome stores profiles with numeric identifiers. To find your profile numbers:

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://version/`
2. Look for the "Profile Path" - it will show something like:
   - `Profile 1` (for the first additional profile)
   - `Profile 2` (for the second additional profile)
   - `Default` (for the default profile)

Alternatively, you can check your Chrome profile directory:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/google-chrome/`
- **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\`

**Step 2: Configure Profile Mappings**

Create or edit `~/.config/awsm/config.toml` and add your Chrome profile mappings:

```toml
[chrome_profiles]
work = "Profile 1"
personal = "Profile 2"
default = "Default"
company = "Profile 3"
```

**Step 3: Use Chrome Profiles**

```bash
# Open console in specific Chrome profile
awsm console --chrome-profile work
awsm console --chrome-profile personal
awsm console --chrome-profile default
```

#### Firefox Container Integration

For Firefox, AWSM relies on the first-party **AWSM Container Opener**
extension — published on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/awsm-container-opener/)
and maintained in a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/AleG03/awsm-firefox-container).
It handles the `ext+container:` protocol used by `awsm console --firefox-container`.

**Step 1: Install the extension**

```bash
# Opens the AMO listing in your browser — click "Add to Firefox"
awsm extension install

# Show extension info and links
awsm extension status
```

The extension installs permanently and auto-updates via AMO.

**Step 2: Use Firefox Containers**

```bash
# Open console in Firefox container (uses profile name as container name)
awsm console --firefox-container

# This will attempt to open the AWS console in a Firefox container
# with the same name as your current AWS profile
```

**Note**: The container name will match your AWS profile name. If you have a profile named `work-production`, AWSM will try to open the console in a Firefox container named `work-production`.

**Deterministic colors and icons**: The AWSM Container Opener derives each
container's color and icon from a hash of its name, so the same AWS profile
always gets the same visual identity. Existing containers are never
re-colored. You can toggle URL-supplied color/icon hints in the extension's
options page if you want the legacy random behavior.

#### Zen Container Integration

Same as Firefox, AWSM can open the AWS console in Zen browser containers.

### Connect & Port Forwarding

AWSM provides a `connect` command (aliased as `ssm` or `con`) to connect to your EC2 instances via AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Session Manager without needing SSH keys or open inbound ports.

It also supports advanced port forwarding capabilities, including forwarding to remote hosts (like RDS databases) through an EC2 bastion.

#### Basic Usage

```bash
# Connect to an instance (opens interactive shell)
awsm connect i-0123456789abcdef0

# Select an instance interactively from a list of running instances
awsm connect
```

#### Port Forwarding

```bash
# Forward a remote port to your local machine
awsm connect i-0123456789abcdef0 --port-forwarding --remote-port 80 --local-port 8080

# Forward to a remote host (e.g., RDS) via the instance
awsm connect i-0123456789abcdef0 -p -r 5432 -H my-db.cluster-c1gqquowm81q.eu-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com
```

#### Configuration Files

You can define your connection parameters in a JSON file for easy reuse:

```bash
# connect.json
{
  "instance_id": "i-0d7211b09c641f135",
  "remote_host": "database-1.cluster-xxx.rds.amazonaws.com",
  "remote_port": 5432,
  "local_port": 5432
}

# Use the config file
awsm connect -f connect.json
```

### Region Management

```bash
# List all available AWS regions
awsm region list

# Set region for default profile
awsm region set us-west-2
```

### Search and Discovery

```bash
# Search everything (profiles, account IDs, SSO sessions)
awsm search my-profile             # Find profiles containing 'my-profile'
awsm search 123456789012           # Find profiles with this account ID
awsm search 1234                   # Find profiles with partial account ID
awsm search test                # Find SSO sessions or profiles with 'test'

# Search specific types only
awsm search --account 8517          # Search only account IDs for '8517'
awsm search --profile prod          # Search only profile names for 'prod'
awsm search --sso my-session       # Search only SSO session names

# Case-sensitive search
awsm search --case-sensitive MyProfile
```

#### Installation

### Shell Completion

AWSM supports tab completion for commands, subcommands, flags, and profile names across multiple shells.

#### Bash

**Linux:**
```bash
# Install completion
awsm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/awsm

# Reload your shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

**macOS:**

```bash
# macOS with Homebrew Fish
sudo awsm completion fish > /usr/local/share/fish/vendor_completions.d/awsm.fish

# Linux systems
sudo awsm completion fish > /usr/share/fish/vendor_completions.d/awsm.fish
```

#### PowerShell

```powershell
# Create PowerShell profile directory if it doesn't exist
if (!(Test-Path -Path $PROFILE)) {
    New-Item -ItemType File -Path $PROFILE -Force
}

# Add completion to your PowerShell profile
awsm completion powershell >> $PROFILE

# Reload your profile
. $PROFILE
```

**Alternative method:**
```powershell
# Generate completion script
awsm completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

#### Testing Completions

After installation, test your completions:

```bash
# Tab complete commands
awsm <TAB>

# Tab complete subcommands
awsm profile <TAB>

# Tab complete profile names
awsm profile set <TAB>

# Tab complete flags
awsm profile list --<TAB>
```

### Software Update

```bash
# Update to latest version
sudo awsm update
```

## Configuration

AWSM uses the standard AWS configuration files:

- `~/.aws/config` - Profile configurations
- `~/.aws/credentials` - Credentials storage

Additional AWSM-specific configuration can be placed in `~/.config/awsm/config.toml`:

```toml
[chrome_profiles]
work = "Profile 1"
personal = "Profile 2"
```

### Profile Types

AWSM supports three types of AWS profiles:

- **SSO Profiles**: Use AWS IAM Identity Center for authentication
- **IAM Profiles**: Use IAM roles with MFA for authentication
- **IAM User Profiles**: Use long-term access keys (not recommended for production)

### Example SSO Session Configuration

```ini
[sso-session my-company]
sso_start_url = https://d-123456789.awsapps.com/start/
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access
```

### Example Profile Configuration

```ini
[profile my-company-admin]
sso_session = my-company
sso_account_id = 123456789012
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess
region = us-east-1
```
